			<h1>About Me</h1>

			<img src="assets/images/portfolio-pic-cropped.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="James Dalton">

			<p>​While other little boys wanted to be cops or cowboys, firemen or astronauts, 8 year old James Dalton wanted nothing more than to be a ScientistInventorEntrepreneur.  His first big break came when he developed a method for making "unbreakable" pencils that he sold to his classmates to be used for "pencil break", a modern-age sword fight epic that required breaking your friend's pencils against your pencils.  After his business was squashed by The Man for being too distracting, James turned his brain towards bigger and better pursuits: designing and building a homemade scooter, building a go-cart, obtaining a B.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering from UT Austin.</p>

			<p>After ten years of marching down the traditional Oil & Gas Mechanical Engineer path with a few detours down the Stay-At-Home-Dad path and the damn-it-I'm-laid-off-what-now-path, the Sugar Land native decided he was ready once again to turn his MindHeartSoul to the ScientistInventorEntrepre​ne​ur path.  After many a late night discussion and a good strong push off the cliff from his wife, he enrolled in a UT programming boot-camp where he is learning to let his 8 year-old self free to explore, learn, code, program, design and play.  With his strong engineering background and aptitude for all things Mechanical, James wants nothing more than to help others pursue their own financial and work freedoms, whether that be through web design, programming, ​Bitcoin pursuits ​or other engineering services</p>

			<p>When he's not locked and loaded behind a computer, James loves inventing games and completing projects with his son, who takes after his Dad's stubborn tenacity.  He also enjoys  watching classic movies and playing chess with his wife.  He occasionally enjoys hanging out with the family dog too, particularly on late nights when everyone else is in bed and the two of them enjoy the stars and moonlight together.</p>
